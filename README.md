# 🌀 Polyrhythm Playground 🎵  
**A Visualization of Polyrhythms with Circular Motion and Harmonious Sound**

This is a creative JavaScript project that explores **polyrhythms** using concepts from **pi (π)** and **trigonometry**. Balls move along concentric tracks at different rotational speeds, creating both **visual rhythm** and **musical harmony** as they align and interact.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🎶 **Polyrhythmic Sound Design** — Each ball represents a different rhythmic cycle, triggering harmonious tones on overlap or sync.
- 🧠 **Math + Music Fusion** — Uses angles, sin/cos, and the concept of π to determine motion paths and rhythmic relationships.
- 🌐 **Browser-based Visualization** — No installations needed. Just open it in your browser!
- 🔁 **Looping Patterns** — Patterns loop and phase, allowing users to experience rhythmic cycles and interference patterns.

## 🛠️ Built With

- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Math: Trigonometry + π to model circular motion

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:queenhekate/Polyrhythms.git
cd Polyrhythms
```

### 2. Open the App

Just open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser:

```bash
open index.html
```

Or deploy it on GitHub Pages / Netlify for easy sharing!

---

## 🔍 How It Works

- Each **ball** or **dot** travels along its own track.
- The speed of each ball is determined by a **multiple of π**
- When balls **intersect with the lateral half of the circle**, they **trigger sounds** (like notes or percussive clicks).

---

## 🧪 Try These Ideas

- Add **more tracks** and balls to increase rhythmic complexity.
- Experiment with **musical scales**, assigning different pitches to different orbits.
- Use **color** and **opacity** to represent volume, timbre, or frequency.

## 🎵 Why Polyrhythms?

Polyrhythms are essential to many musical traditions—from West African drumming to classical compositions. This project offers a **visual way to learn** about rhythm, phase shifting, and mathematical beauty in sound.

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Understand how **circular motion** relates to time and rhythm
- Apply **trigonometric functions** for animation
- Appreciate the intersection of **math, art, and code**

---

## 🧠 Inspired By

- Steve Reich’s *"Phase Music"*
- Vi Hart’s musical-math videos
- The natural harmony of math and rhythm
